<h1>About</h1>

<p>This is my personal website, where I will write about various projects I'm doing and in general whatever catches my fancy.</p>

<p>I'm Ruan, a South African programmer enrolled in university for Computer Science and Mathematics. I'm a Christian and belong to a Dutch Reformed denomination (NHKA).</p>

<p>Expect the following:</p>

<ul>
    <li>Programming</li>
    <li>Mathematics</li>
    <li>Bilingual Content (hopefully)</li>
    <li><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Constructed_language">Conlanging</a> and Amateur Linguistics</li>
    <li>Possibly: Philosophy and Theology</li>
</ul>

<h2>Contact</h2>

<p>If you know me in person, or know someone who does, feel free to contact me on WhatsApp.</p>

<p>Otherwise, my email is my name @ my domain. Note that I might not respond promptly, especially if I do not know you.</p>
