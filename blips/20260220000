And finally I have a preliminary working implementation of blips! We'll see if and how much I use this... <br>
Honestly, I might just use it quite a bit, but just update the website every second or third day. <br>
<br>
...and now I wanna make an rss feed for this. That'd be fun. But who's gonna subscribe to essentially just the one dude's tweets? Idk. Probably nobody's gonna subscribe to my blog either, so I might as well
